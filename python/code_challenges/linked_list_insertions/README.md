# Challenge Summary
- **Challenge Type**: Extending an Implementation
- append
  * arguments: new value
  * adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
- insert before
  * arguments: value, new value
  * adds a new node with the given new value immediately before the first node that has the value specified

- insert after
  * arguments: value, new value
  * adds a new node with the given new value immediately after the first node that has the value specified

### Write tests to prove the following functionality:

1. Can successfully add a node to the end of the linked list
2. Can successfully add multiple nodes to the end of a linked list
3. Can successfully insert a node before a node located i the middle of a linked list
4. Can successfully insert a node before the first node of a linked list
5. Can successfully insert after a node in the middle of the linked list
6. Can successfully insert a node after the last node of the linked list
