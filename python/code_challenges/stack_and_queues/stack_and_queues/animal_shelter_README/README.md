# Multi-bracket Validation

## White Board
![](Code_Challenge_13.jpg)

## Challenge
- Write a function called validate brackets
- Arguments: string
- Return: boolean
  * representing whether or not the brackets in the string are balanced
- There are 3 types of brackets:
  * Round Brackets : ()
  * Square Brackets : []
  * Curly Brackets : {}


### Write tests to prove the following functionality:
[tests](stack_and_queues/tests/../../../../tests/test_stack_queue_brackets.py)
- Still having issues running my testing files. I'm going to reconstruct my file structure ASAP

## Approach & Efficiency
- Created whiteboard before diving into code:
  * Identified problem domain, edge cases, input/output, created visualization demo, and wrote algo.
- Wrote method
- Wrote tests to verify method's functionality

### Time Log

- Start Time: 7:30pm
- End Time: 9:45pm
## Credits and Colaborations
