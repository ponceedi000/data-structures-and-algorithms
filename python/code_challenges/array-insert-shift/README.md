# Insert and shift an array in middle at index
Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and a value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

## Approach & Efficiency

- ***Minhang Xie*** and I, pair-programmed this coding challenge together on Dec 9th 2021
- We started off by writing out the Problem Domain to better understand what were solving. We then identified our input: (list, new_num) and our Output: List with new num in the middle index of list
- To accomplish this output, we first drew a visual representation of our idea. We wanted to picture how we solve this without using the slice() method. This was not easy!
- We then wrote out our algorithm which explains our thought process of makng this work. Next, we moved into Pseudo code to which help a lot for the code portion of the whiteboard.
- Our algorithm felt really good at this point so lastly, we ran the code and it passed a few simple tests.
