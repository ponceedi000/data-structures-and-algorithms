# Binary search in a sorted 1D array
Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the value of the search key, or -1 if the element is not in the array.
NOTE: The search algorithm used in your function should be a binary search.

## Approach & Efficiency

- **Wenhao** and I, pair-programmed this coding challenge together on Dec 13th 2021
- We started off by writing out the Problem Domain to better understand what were solving. We then identified our input: (sorted_list, target_num) and our Output: return the value of our target num from the list.
- To accomplish this output, we first drew a visual representation of our idea. We wanted to picture how we solve this without using too many built-in functions. This was not easy!
- We then wrote out our algorithm which explains our thought process of makng this work.
- Our algorithm felt really good at this point so lastly, we ran multiple tests for differn't scenarios and did not notice any flaws in our logic.
