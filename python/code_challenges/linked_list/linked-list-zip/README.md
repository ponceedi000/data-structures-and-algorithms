# Challenge Summary
- Write the following method for the Linked List class:

  * Write a function called zip lists
  * Arguments: 2 linked lists
  * Return: New Linked List, zipped as noted below
  * Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the the zipped list.
  * Try and keep additional space down to O(1)
  * You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.

## Approach & Efficiency
- ***Osborn Del Angel*** and I, pair-programmed this coding challenge together on Jan 3rd 2021
- We started off by writing out the Problem Domain to better understand what were solving. We then identified our input: 2 seperate linked lists, and our Output: zipper effect with both linked lists combined.
- We then wrote out our algorithm which explains our thought process of makng this work. Next, we moved into Pseudo code to which helped a lot for the code portion of the whiteboard.
- Our algorithm felt really good after writing it. We conducted our unit testing (visually) and to provide good testing coverage.
- I begin writing solution code and testing in editor soon.
## Unit Testing
- pending
